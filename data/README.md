#### Erdos-Reyni Graph

The present weighted edgelist data is a random [Erdős–Rényi model]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model).

It contains 10000 nodes. Each edge has been included with probability ```p=0.05```. The edge weights were generated as using ``` np.random.randint(0, 100)``` and thus are comprised within the ```[0, 100)``` interval. There are more than 2500000 edges.
